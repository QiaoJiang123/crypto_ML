# Cryptocurrency Machine Learning Strategy

This project is to develop trading strategies for cryptocurrencies using machine learning models. More specifically, 
this project has the following objectives:<br/>

1. Clean data from various data sources including polygon.io and EDGAR for modeling
2. Display statistical facts of cryptocurrencies including correlation, normal test, trending, optimal time window, big return, etc.
3. Develop the pipeline for strategy finding
4. Utilize wide range of machine learning models for different tasks, including BERT, RNN, LSTM, regression, etc., through strategy development.

Note that the main objective of this project is not to show the profitable strategies, which will not be disclosed once being found. Instead, the project
shows how we get closer to the profitable one and provide tools and scripts to facilitate the process.

Also, the project may share some trading strategy that is close to success and the one that leads to failure due to interesting reasons.

## Data Source

There are two data sources:

1. polygon.io
2. EDGAR
